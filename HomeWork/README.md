# Collection of Data Analytics Projects

# Objective:
To facilitate driving decisions based on a deeper understanding of data through analytics, I started a journey as an explorer to extract insights from data and present them to help with better decision making and open up new possibilities. These are a collection of projects that have helped me in getting an in-depth exposure to various tools and technologies that can be used to slice, dice and represent data.
